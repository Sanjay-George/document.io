## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v20 or higher preferred): [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Docker** : [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sanjay-George/document.io.git
   cd document.io
   ```

2. **Install dependencies for both backend and frontend:**

   ```bash
   # Install dependencies for the backend
   npm install
   
   # Install dependencies for the frontend
   cd ui
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables:**

   Copy `.env.example` and create `.env` file,  in root and `ui` folders. Update the values appropriately.


4. **Setup Database with Docker Compose**

   The project includes a `docker-compose.yml` file to set up MongoDB and Mongo Express for database management. You can run this with Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d mongo mongo-express
   ```

   By default, MongoDB is set up with the username `root` and password `example`. If you want to change the MongoDB password, modify the MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD field in the docker-compose.yml file and update the `.env` file with the new credentials.

5. **Start the development servers:**

   ```bash
   # start node server in root folder
   npm run dev

   # start next server in ./ui
   cd ui
   npm run dev
   ```

   By default, the node server will run on port 5000, and next server on port 3000. If you modify the port of the node server, update `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` variable in `ui/.env` file.

   

7. **Access the application:**
   
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000` to use the application
  


 Enjoy documenting ðŸŽ‰
